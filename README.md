This is the inaugural project developed utilizing HTML, CSS, and Figma, created with the assistance of GoIT. In this project, HTML is employed to structure the content, providing a solid foundation of elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS is used to style these elements, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design across different devices and screen sizes. Figma plays a crucial role in the design phase, allowing for the creation of detailed prototypes and user interfaces before the development process begins. This combination of tools, along with the guidance and support from GoIT, not only facilitates a seamless workflow but also ensures that the final product is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Overall, this project represents a significant learning experience, showcasing the effective integration of design and development principles.
